ImagePatch is a Python class with the following methods:
    - find returns a bounding box 
    - verify property returns a score how likely an object contains an attribute
    - overlaps_with returns true if ImagePatch 1 contains ImagePatch 2
    - llm_query asks a question to GPT3 
ImagePatch has the following attributes:
    - left, lower, right, upper, horizontal_center, vertical_center 
 
Examples:
Query: Which caption is correct: "the horse is eating the grass" or "the grass is eating the horse"?
    >>> def execute_command(image):
    >>>     image_patch = ImagePath(image)
    >>>     horse = image_patch.find('horse')
    >>>     grass = image_patch.find('grass')
    >>>     horse_eating = horse.verify_property('horse','eating')
    >>>     grass_eating = grass.verify_property('grass','eating')
    >>>     horse_eating_grass = horse.verify_property('horse','eating grass')
    >>>     grass_eating_horse = grass.verify_property('grass','eating horse')
    >>>     if horse_eating + horse_eating_grass>grass_eating+horse_eating_grass:
    >>>         return "horse is eating the grass"
    >>>     else:
    >>>         return "the grass is eating the horse"
Query: Which caption is correct: "the computer is on the books" or "the books are on the computer"?
    >>> def execute_command(image):
    >>>     image_patch = ImagePatch(image)
    >>>     computer = image_patch.find('computer')
    >>>     books = image_patch.find('books')
    >>>     
    >>>     if v_b > v_c:
    >>>         return "the computer is on the books"
    >>>     else:
    >>>         return "the books are on the computer"
Query: Which caption is correct: "the truck is above the ground" or "the ground is above the truck"?
    >>> def execute_command(image):

    >>>     computer,_,v_t = image_patch.find('truck')
    >>>     books,_,v_g = image_patch.find('ground')
    >>>     if v_t > v_g:
    >>>         return "the ground is above the truck"
    >>>     else:
    >>>         return "the truck is above the ground"
Query: Which caption is correct: "the ball is in the water" or "the water is in the ball"?
>>>     def execute_command(image):
>>>           ball,_,_ = image_patch.find('ball')
>>>           water,_,_ = image_patch.find('water')
>>>           if ball.overlaps_with(water):
>>>             return "the ball is in the water"
>>>           else:
>>>             return "the water is in the ball"
Query: Which caption is correct: "the table is to the left of the window" or "the window is to the left of the table"?
>>>     def execute_command(image):
>>>           image_patch = ImagePatch(image)
>>>           table,h_t,v_t = image_patch.find('table')
>>>           window,h_w,v_w = image_patch.find('window')
>>>           if h_t < h_w:
>>>             return "the table is to the left of the window"
>>>           else:
>>>              return "the window is to the left of the table"
Query: Which caption is correct: "the man is to the right of the woman" or "the woman is to the right of the man"?
>>>     def execute_command(image):
>>>           image_patch = ImagePatch(image)
>>>           man,h_m,v_m = image_patch.find('man')
>>>           woman,h_w,v_w = image_patch.find('woman')
>>>           if h_m < h_w :
>>>             return "the woman is to the right of the man"
>>>           else:
>>>              return "the man is to the right of the woman"

Write a function using Python and the ImagePatch class (above) that could be executed to provide an answer to the query. 

Consider the following guidelines:
- Use base Python (comparison, sorting) for basic logical operations, left/right/up/down, math, etc.
- Use if/else statements
- Always return one of the statements given in the query
Query: INSERT_QUERY_HERE
